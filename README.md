The soil microbiome is vital to a plant's overall health and development. Drought can affect the abundance of soil microbial communities, plant productivity, and plant health. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an economically important crop worldwide that can be at risk of infection with Aspergillus flavus during heat and drought, which increases the risk of carcinogenic aflatoxin contamination. We hypothesize that applying different water regimes to peanut soils will alter the microbial composition over time and reveal microbes that may also thrive under dry conditions to compete with A. flavus. Two soils from different fields with a history of peanut production were collected at Wiregrass Research and Extension Center Headland, Alabama. The soilswere placed in polyvinylchloride tubes inside a growth chamber (29Â°C). Five water regimes in a gradient from dry to wet conditions were applied to the soils for nine weeks. They were sampled every other week, and the ITS1 for fungi and 16S for bacteria and archeae amplicons were sequenced to determine the effect of the moisture treatments on the microbial communities. Time, soil, and treatments significantly impacted both prokaryote and fungal communities. Bacterial Phylum Actinobacteriota thrived in drier treatments and Proteobacteria on moist ones. This helps us understand that Actinobacteria may be a good target against A. flavus because it can survive under dry soil conditions.
